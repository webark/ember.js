/**
  An `Ember.Component` is a view that is completely
  isolated. Properties accessed in its templates go
  to the view object and actions are targeted at
  the view object. There is no access to the
  surrounding context or outer controller; all
  contextual information must be passed in.

  The easiest way to create an `Ember.Component` is via
  a template. If you name a template
  `components/my-foo`, you will be able to use
  `{{my-foo}}` in other templates, which will make
  an instance of the isolated component.

  ```handlebars
  {{app-profile person=currentUser}}
  ```

  ```handlebars
  <!-- app-profile template -->
  <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>
  <img src={{person.avatar}}>
  <p class='signature'>{{person.signature}}</p>
  ```

  You can use `yield` inside a template to
  include the **contents** of any block attached to
  the component. The block will be executed in the
  context of the surrounding context or outer controller:

  ```handlebars
  {{#app-profile person=currentUser}}
    <p>Admin mode</p>
    {{! Executed in the controller's context. }}
  {{/app-profile}}
  ```

  ```handlebars
  <!-- app-profile template -->
  <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>
  {{! Executed in the component's context. }}
  {{yield}} {{! block contents }}
  ```

  If you want to customize the component, in order to
  handle events or actions, you implement a subclass
  of `Ember.Component` named after the name of the
  component. Note that `Component` needs to be appended to the name of
  your subclass like `AppProfileComponent`.

  For example, you could implement the action
  `hello` for the `app-profile` component:

  ```javascript
  App.AppProfileComponent = Ember.Component.extend({
    actions: {
      hello: function(name) {
        console.log("Hello", name);
      }
    }
  });
  ```

  And then use it in the component's template:

  ```handlebars
  <!-- app-profile template -->

  <h1>{{person.title}}</h1>
  {{yield}} <!-- block contents -->

  <button {{action 'hello' person.name}}>
    Say Hello to {{person.name}}
  </button>
  ```

  Components must have a `-` in their name to avoid
  conflicts with built-in controls that wrap HTML
  elements. This is consistent with the same
  requirement in web components.

  @class Component
  @namespace Ember
  @extends Ember.View
  @uses Ember.ViewTargetActionSupport
  @public

const Component = View.extend(TargetActionSupport, ActionSupport, {
  isComponent: true,

  instrumentName: 'component',
  instrumentDisplay: computed(function() {
    if (this._debugContainerKey) {
      return '{{' + this._debugContainerKey.split(':')[1] + '}}';
    }
  }),

  init() {
    this._super(...arguments);

    // If a `defaultLayout` was specified move it to the `layout` prop.
    // `layout` is no longer a CP, so this just ensures that the `defaultLayout`
    // logic is supported with a deprecation
    if (this.defaultLayout && !this.layout) {
      deprecate(
        `Specifying \`defaultLayout\` to ${this} is deprecated. Please use \`layout\` instead.`,
        false,

          url: 'http://emberjs.com/deprecations/v2.x/#toc_ember-component-defaultlayout'
        }
      );

      this.layout = this.defaultLayout;
    }

    // If in a tagless component, assert that no event handlers are defined
    assert(
      `You can not define a function that handles DOM events in the \`${this}\` tagless component since it doesn't have any DOM element.`,
      this.tagName !== '' || !environment.hasDOM || !(() => {
        let eventDispatcher = getOwner(this).lookup('event_dispatcher:main');
        let events = (eventDispatcher && eventDispatcher._finalEvents) || {};

        for (let key in events) {
          let methodName = events[key];

          if (typeof this[methodName]  === 'function') {
            return true; // indicate that the assertion should be triggered
          }
        }
      }
    )());
  },

  /**
    Normally, Ember's component model is "write-only". The component takes a
    bunch of attributes that it got passed in, and uses them to render its
    template.

    One nice thing about this model is that if you try to set a value to the
    same thing as last time, Ember (through HTMLBars) will avoid doing any
    work on the DOM.

    This is not just a performance optimization. If an attribute has not
    changed, it is important not to clobber the element's "hidden state".
    For example, if you set an input's `value` to the same value as before,
    it will clobber selection state and cursor position. In other words,
    setting an attribute is not **always** idempotent.

    This method provides a way to read an element's attribute and also
    update the last value Ember knows about at the same time. This makes
    setting an attribute idempotent.

    In particular, what this means is that if you get an `<input>` element's
    `value` attribute and then re-render the template with the same value,
    it will avoid clobbering the cursor and selection position.

    Since most attribute sets are idempotent in the browser, you typically
    can get away with reading attributes using jQuery, but the most reliable
    way to do so is through this method.

    @method readDOMAttr
    @param {String} name the name of the attribute
    @return String
    @public
  */
  readDOMAttr(name) {
    let attr = this._renderNode.childNodes.filter(node => node.attrName === name)[0];
    if (!attr) { return null; }
    return attr.getContent();
  },

  /**
    Returns true when the component was invoked with a block template.

    Example (`hasBlock` will be `false`):

    ```hbs
    {{! templates/application.hbs }}

    {{foo-bar}}

    {{! templates/components/foo-bar.hbs }}
    {{#if hasBlock}}
      This will not be printed, because no block was provided
    {{/if}}
    ```

    Example (`hasBlock` will be `true`):

    ```hbs
    {{! templates/application.hbs }}

    {{#foo-bar}}
      Hi!
    {{/foo-bar}}

    {{! templates/components/foo-bar.hbs }}
    {{#if hasBlock}}
      This will be printed because a block was provided
      {{yield}}
    {{/if}}
    ```

    This helper accepts an argument with the name of the block we want to check the presence of.
    This is useful for checking for the presence of the optional inverse block in components.

    ```hbs
    {{! templates/application.hbs }}

    {{#foo-bar}}
      Hi!
    {{else}}
      What's up?
    {{/foo-bar}}

    {{! templates/components/foo-bar.hbs }}
    {{yield}}
    {{#if (hasBlock "inverse")}}
      {{yield to="inverse"}}
    {{else}}
      How are you?
    {{/if}}
    ```

    @public
    @property hasBlock
    @param {String} [blockName="default"] The name of the block to check presence of.

  /**
    Enables components to take a list of parameters as arguments.

    For example, a component that takes two parameters with the names
    `name` and `age`:

    ```javascript
    let MyComponent = Ember.Component.extend;
    MyComponent.reopenClass({
      positionalParams: ['name', 'age']
    });
    ```

    It can then be invoked like this:

    ```hbs
    {{my-component "John" 38}}
    ```

    The parameters can be referred to just like named parameters:

    ```hbs
    Name: {{attrs.name}}, Age: {{attrs.age}}.
    ```

    Using a string instead of an array allows for an arbitrary number of
    parameters:

    ```javascript
    let MyComponent = Ember.Component.extend;
    MyComponent.reopenClass({

    });
    ```

    It can then be invoked like this:

    ```hbs
    {{my-component "John" "Michael" "Scott"}}

    The parameters can then be referred to by enumerating over the list:

    ```hbs
    {{#each attrs.names as |name|}}{{name}}{{/each}}
